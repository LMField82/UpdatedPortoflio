                    <p>I was born and raised in Reno, Nevada. After I graduated high school, I left for Los Angeles to attend The University of Southern California. I studied biomedical engineering for a while, but finally decided on a degree in Mathematics.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from USC, I entered the education world. I worked first as a tutor and teaching assistant for 6th grade. I was asked to teach high school Geometry on an emergency credential. I fell in love with teaching. I really enjoyed interacting with the students and I loved the content. However, I decided to leave the profession for a myriad of reasons.</p>
                    <p>From there I pursued some passions of mine. I worked for a small jewelry company making silver jewelry. I learned how to sew and I took up painting. I also began playing around with some basic html and css on codecademy. I instantly loved it, but after finishing their free courses life got hectic and my coding was pushed to the side.</p>
                    <p>My husband and I had tried for years to get pregnant, we finally did and I gave birth to a baby girl. After having my daughter, we moved to Denver, Colorado to be closer to my husband's family. It was in Denver that I again rekindled my love of coding. I decided to take a coding bootcamp through The University of Denver. I know that my training has prepared me for a new career as a web developer.</p>
